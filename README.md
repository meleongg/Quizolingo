## Inspiration
Since the start of my first year at UBC, I've been challenging myself to improve
my French and Mandarin skills. Whenever I encountered a new word, I would jot it down
on a piece of paper. However, this piece of paper quickly became messy and illegible. So, I 
want to create a Java application to keep track of my learning
for me. I hope to never have to worry about running out of paper space ever again!
